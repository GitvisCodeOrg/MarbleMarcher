# Marble Marcher

Marble Marcher is a video game demo that uses a fractal physics engine and fully procedural rendering to produce beautiful and unique gameplay unlike anything you've seen before.

The goal of the game is to reach the flag as quickly as possible.  But be careful not to
fall off the level or get crushed by the fractal!  There are 15 levels to unlock.

## System Dependencies
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [SFML 2.5.0](https://www.sfml-dev.org)

On macOS these can be conveniently installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install eigen sfml`

(Note that SFML might require a newer version than the one from Homebrew, in which case a manual installation is required)

Alternatively, [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) can be used:

`vcpkg install eigen3 sfml`

## Building
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
    * If you use `vcpkg`, add the flag `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path/to/vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
* `cd ..`
* `cmake --build build`

Alternatively, one can use the platform-dependent build system, for example `Make`:

* `make -C build`

## Launching
* Make sure that the current working directory contains the `assets` folder
* Run the executable generated by CMake, located in `build` (or a subdirectory)
